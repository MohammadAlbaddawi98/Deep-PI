# Deep PI 
# AmazonTechathon2020

In this project there are two main files ,first one wrote using python in order to detect driver fatigue and alert the driver & the second one is arduino file use to send location and SOS message 
to spasific Phone number after a period.

Summary
* opencv captures and haarcascade_frontalface detect user face
* after that dlib-model detect facial point annotations
* Rasspberry pi send spacific value to Arduino mega after spacific period
* arduino must connect to wifi (wifi_name= DEEP_PI , PASS=12345678)
* Arduino send gps location to driver's family or friend in order to help.

## Requirements

1. Python	3.6
2. dlib         19.8.1
3.imutils       0.5.3
